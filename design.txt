SpaceDef and ValueDef for defining the space of actions and observations.

Agent:
	C++ side of things.
	Must be capable of starting an instance of the Godot game engine programmatically.
	Start communication with the environment, throw exception if something fails.
	This is the easier to implement part of the library.

Environment:
	This will be an instance of the Godot game engine with the RuntimeNode inside it for communication purposes.
	A specific environment will have to be installed onto the computer prior to usage.
	Then the environment must be either registered for use, or be capable of being found in some way.

	Must initialize the observation space and the action space.
	Those can be a dictionary of values.

	Every step of the scene must enact the action given by the agent,
	then calculate the reward, the observation, and determine if the end condition has been met.


The communication protocol:
	Step by step:
		agent starts the executable
		environment connects, acknowledge connection
		environment sends the definitions for action and observation space
		
		agent sends reset command, environment returns the initial step
		agent sends step command + action data, environment returns step data

		agent sends close command, executable closes.

	Serialization:
		No need to worry about endianess for now, this is essentially ipc.
		Exceptional circumstances need a way to be handled, the agent or the environment could encounter some kind of issue.

		requests:
			observation_space -> no data in request, reply with observation space definition
			action_space -> no data in request, reply with action space definition
			reset -> no data in request, reply with initial step data
			step -> request contains action data, reply with step data
			close -> no data on either side, connection will be closed

Todo:
	Provide a way to serialize and deserialize Step, SpaceDef, Space, ValueDef, Value.
	Test the zeromq connection with some arbitrary data.
	Implement the Environment class, give it a MessageContext.
	Implement the RuntimeNode class, give it a MessageContext.
	Test running a Godot instance programmatically.
	Design an interface for the Godot side of things, allow the environment to setup SpaceDef from GDScript.
