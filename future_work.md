- [x] Simplify the `Space` class
- [x] Simplify the `Value` class
- [x] Expand the `Value` class types
- [ ] Give the `Value` class a range for its values (Clamp or verify ranges?)
- [x] Give `Value` class assignment capabilities
- [x] Test the `Value` class assignment methods and constructors
- [x] Simplify the message context
- [x] Provide some tests for the message context
- [ ] Allow the message context to connect to remote hosts as well? (`ZeroMQ` allows for this fairly easily)
- [ ] Create static binding wrapper for the `Value` class
- [ ] Create static binding wrapper for the `Space` class (More difficult, requires macros...)
- [x] Provide optional initialization parameter passing to the environment
- [x] Make dictionary in Godot for the `Space`
- [x] Make a `Value` wrapper in Godot
  - [x] Provide constructors for making values in Godot?
  - [ ] Create reference class for subset of value (accepting dynamic iterator type to identify selection)
  - [ ] Method for accessing elements via Array of indices (if object is iterable)
  - [x] Method for accessing elements via single index
  - [x] Method for accessing elements via multidimensional indices
  - [ ] `slice` accessor
  - [ ] `row` accessor
  - [ ] `col` accessor
  - [x] Iteration capabilities for value
- [ ] Change all the existing environment examples to work with the new setup
